# Your free queries on The Graph are running low

Hello,

We'd like to notify you that at your current rate of usage, you will run out of your monthly quota of free queries on The Graph Network in {{ daysUntilFreeQueriesExhausted }} days.

If you have not set up payments on your account yet, you will no longer be able to make queries after your free queries run out. This will remain in effect until your free query quota resets at the end of the month. To continue making queries beyond the free monthly quota, please set up your billing plan in Subgraph Studio to avoid any service interruptions. Learn more at https://thegraph.com/docs/en/billing/.
