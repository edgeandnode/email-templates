Hello,

Weâ€™ve noticed that your Consumer subscription plan for The Graph is running low. Currently, you have used {{ queriesUsed }} of your monthly queries, but still have {{ billingPeriodRemaining }} of your billing period remaining. Based on your current usage, we recommend upgrading your monthly quota to {{ recommendedMonthlyQuota }} million queries.

<a email-cta href="https://thegraph.com/billing/?show=manage">Upgrade now</a>

If no action is taken before you reach your monthly quota, queries made through your subscription will no longer work for the remaining of your current billing period. To avoid potential downtime, please upgrade now.
