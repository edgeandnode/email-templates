# Service Reactivated

Hello,

Your billing balance on The Graph is now current, and you may now resume making queries. You have a billing balance of {{ balance }} GRT, covering {{ queryFees }} GRT in query fees. Review your query activity any time on the Billing page in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/billing/).

To avoid service interruption, please ensure your billing balance is greater than your incurred query fees.

To learn more about The Graph's billing plans, see our Docs at [thegraph.com/docs/en/billing/](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/billing/).
