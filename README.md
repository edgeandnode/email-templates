# To-do

- [ ] Move this to a separate repo so technical non-engineer contributors can also contribute?

# Notes

- Campaign monitor uses Liquid. This is not our own choice.
- We need links in e-mails, so we keep a directory with HTMLs for quick preview.
- Developers upload the exported Liquid HTMLs to Campaign Monitor.
